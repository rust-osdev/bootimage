USAGE:
    bootimage [OPTIONS]                         Help and version information
    bootimage build [BUILD_OPTS]                Create a bootable disk image
    bootimage run [BUILD_OPTS] -- [RUN_OPTS]    Build and run a disk image
    bootimage test [BUILD_OPTS]                 Runs integration tests

For more information about a subcommand run `bootimage [subcommand] --help`.

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help      Prints help information and exit
    ---version      Prints version information and exit

BUILD_OPTS:
    Any options are directly passed to `cargo build` (see
    `cargo build --help` for possible options). After building, a bootloader
    is downloaded and built, and then combined with the kernel into a bootable
    disk image.

    For configuration options see `bootimage build --help`.

RUN_OPTS:
    Any options are directly passed to the run command. Note that the run
    options must be separated from the build options by a "--".

    For configuration options see `bootimage run --help`.
